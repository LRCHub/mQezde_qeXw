Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
You hit like a drunk cigarette
The feelin' amplified
By sayin' things we never meant,
oh, yeah
You leave me filled with regret
At the end of the night
I always find myself
wonderin' why, oh, yeah
Do you got plans for life?
'Cause I don't wanna
just romance tonight
I wanna see you in another light,
oh, yeah
With rhythm, there is rhyme
With you, there always can be I
I wanna see you in another light,
ooh
I don't wanna talk down on
your lover
I don't wanna be a homewrecker
I just know I can be better,
be better, be better
I don't wanna talk down on
your lover
I don't wanna be a broken record
I just know I can be better,
be better, be better
We sit on the fire escape
We talk and talk 'til dawn
I open up to you about my wrongs,
oh, yeah
Then we lay and contemplate
Just one more round of love
Before you go home to
another one
Do you got plans for life?
'Cause I don't wanna
just romance tonight
I wanna see you in another light,
oh, yeah
With rhythm, there is rhyme
With you, there always can be I
I wanna see you in another light,
ooh
I don't wanna talk down on
your lover
I don't wanna be a homewrecker
I just know I can be better,
be better, be better
I don't wanna talk down on
your lover
I don't wanna be a broken record
I just know I can be better,
be better, be better
I don't wanna be how
you formulate opinions
on astrology, oh no
Or to say we made peace
And then your friends don't
even wanna talk to me, no more,
no more
I wanna kiss you on the bed
and on the floor
When I'm poor, when I'm bored
I am yours, I am yours,
I am yours
I don't wanna talk down on
your lover
I don't wanna be a homewrecker
I just know I can be better,
be better, be better
I don't wanna talk down on
your lover
I don't wanna be a broken record
I just know I can be better,
be better, be better
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
(Oh-oh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
(Oh-oh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
(Oh-oh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
