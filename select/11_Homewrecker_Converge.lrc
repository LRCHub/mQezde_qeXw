[00:12.35] I have bled and I have given
[00:15.48] The longest of rivers and the longest of ropes
[00:23.16] And you're not grasping and my light is sinking on the horizon
[00:43.15] Knee deep among your wreckage and uncertainty
[00:46.47] With anguish my crown and heartbreak my throne
[01:27.53] I lay claim to this day - No love, no hope
[03:34.06] I've lost count of the second chances
[03:46.17] I lay claim to this day - No love, no hope.
