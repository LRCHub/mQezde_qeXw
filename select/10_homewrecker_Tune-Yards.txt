Thinking 'bout your money
Think about the homes you wreck
Never mind the money
Thinking 'bout your m-m-m-m-m-money

I'm looking for a home
I'm looking for a home
Since I don't come from anywhere a house will make me strong
A longing to belong
A longing to belong
I asked you for redemption and I sang a little song
A pre-approval for a life of wiping history away
A pre-approval for a debt that I will never pay
Dare yourself to think it, think it all the way through
Dare yourself to think 'cause every day it comes true

Thinking 'bout your money
Think about the homes you wreck
(Never mind the money
Thinking 'bout your m-m-m-m-m-money)

I'm looking for my people
I cannot find my people
I lost them in the killings at the temple and the steeple
I feel so overwhelmed
Abandoned and ashamed
So I remain the passenger, the driver is deranged
I ate your babies from the nest where you were keeping them safe
I called it safety when I doomed you to both prison and rape
So I comfort ate, so I comfort
Ate your eggs so greedily and sickness was my fate

Oh, somewhere there's a place I'll find my rhyme
And wind up nowhere that is mine
Tending to the mending of the troubled times
Oh, somewhere there's a place I'll find my rhyme
And wind up nowhere that is mine
Tending to the mending of the troubled times

Thinking 'bout your money
Think about the homes you wreck
Thinking 'bout your money
Think about the homes you wreck
Thinking 'bout your money
Asking 'bout the home you wreck
Thinking 'bout your money
Asking 'bout the home you wreck

(Oh, somewhere there's a place I'll find my rhyme
And wind up nowhere that is mine)
