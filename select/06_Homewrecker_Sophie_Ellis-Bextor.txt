I see the way that you look at him
What makes you think that he's yours to win
You're showing off just trying to catch his eye
(Run along get your own guy)

The way your hand lingers on his arm
He makes a joke, you laugh a bit too hard
I know the tricks, it makes me sick inside
(Run along get your own guy)

(Oh oh oh oh oh) You know i'm onto you
(Oh oh oh oh oh) Know what you're trying to do
(Oh oh oh oh oh) But there's a name for you
(Oh oh oh oh oh) Ho. Ho. Homewrecker

To all you girls around the world
Stealing someone else's guy
You're going around breaking hearts
It ain't gonna work this time
(I know your kind)

So very cheap, devoid of any class
There's no mistique from your assorted parts
I'm still the boss, get lost, good luck, goodbye
(Run along and get your own guy)

(Oh oh oh oh oh) You know i'm onto you
(Oh oh oh oh oh) Know what you're trying to do
(Oh oh oh oh oh) But there's a name for you
(Oh oh oh oh oh) Ho. Ho. Homewrecker

To all you girls around the world
Stealing someone else's guy
You're going around breaking hearts
It ain't gonna work this time
(I know your kind)
